<a href="https://adventofcode.com" target="_blank">**Advent of Code**</a> is created by <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank">Eric Wastl</a>. It is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

Many thanks to Eric for creating such a fun event. This repo holds my solutions for these puzzles. The `inputs` directory holds the puzzle inputs. The description of the puzzles are included in the python scripts. To get the puzzle answers, simply run the python script with the `inputs` directory in the same directory.

Cheers !
